Garmin data fields for ultra racing

## Data Fields

### Current Stop

Displays the duration of the time you have been stationary during your current stop. Popped into a shop? This data field will tell you how long you were stopped for.

### Total Stopped

Displays the total duration you have not been moving for in the current activity. This data field tracks the total time you've been stopped. The least stopped, the more efficient you are.

### Distance to Next

Displays the distance in metres or kilometres to the next waypoint, navigation point or course point. You must have an active course in order for this data field to work.

### Time to Next
